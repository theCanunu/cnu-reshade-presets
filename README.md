# cnu-reshade-presets
this is where my reshade presets will go

# Notes
I personally Like to have my folders a little different. I'm not entirely sure how reshade handles preset importing, but my folder structure goes a little like this:

`
gamedirectory
  reshade (originally reshade-shaders)
    presets
      cnu_preset.ini
    shaders
    textures
`

# GAMES
## SnowRunner
Primarily deepens the blacks and enhances the coolours. Nothing Special, but an improvement in my opinion.
