# cnu-reshade-presets
this is where my reshade presets will go

# Notes
I personally Like to have my folders a little different. I'm not entirely sure how reshade handles preset importing, but my folder structure goes a little like this:

```
+-- gamedirectory    
  +-- reshade
    +-- presets
      +-- cnu_preset.ini
    +-- shaders
    +-- textures
```
In each game folder will be:
- images (inside folder)
- the preset
- settings file (in markdown)
- basic "readme" file on what my goal was.

# GAMES
## SnowRunner
Primarily deepens the blacks and enhances the coolours. Nothing Special, but an improvement in my opinion.
